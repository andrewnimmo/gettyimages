# Getty Images API SDK - PHP
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gettyimages/gettyimages-api_php.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gettyimages/gettyimages-api_php)

Please refer to https://github.com/gettyimages/gettyimages-api_php for complete documentation. I made this repository to bypass cURL SSL validation issue. I created an issue in github but they didn't respond to me properly, so I modified it myself and put it here for everybody to use.

#Installing with composer
{
  "require": {
       "getty/gettyimages-api": "dev-master"
  }
}
